			<h4>Historical background and origin</h4>
			<hr>
			<p>Geospatial Development and Research Hub (GeoDR Hub) was established in 2020 but officially initiated on
				00/00/2021 with 9 founding members. The idea to build the Hub was brought up 2 years  graduating with a
				Bachelor's degree in Geography and Urban Planning. With a strong ambition to bring what we learned in
				college into practice, we found very limited opportunities to apply this knowledge to get money.
				We both wanted to develop our knowledge specifically in the field of geographic information systems
				and use it to combat the problems that society faces. In fact, there are many problems that need the
				application of the latest knowledge to address the causes and consequences as well as provide solutions.
				Geospatial information technology can be used for decision making as it is exactly what society needs
				today to achieve sustainable development.
			</p>
			<p>
				Since we thought we have this knowledge but limited opportunities to get a supportive entity to apply
				this knowledge on the ground, we thought of joining our forces and implementing what we have in mind.
				We held many discussions and meetings and decided to form a strong team to provide
				geospatial technology services. These ideas came to fruition in 2020, but due to the Covid 19 pandemic,
				the launch of the project was temporarily halted and did not resume until 2021. However, after a period
				of ups and downs, various discussions were undertaken and it was agreed to establish a geospatial
				services company. The dream came true when we completed the agreement and the company was officially
				started on 00/00/2021 with 9 members as mentioned at the beginning of this section. This happened after
				we realized that the benefits of having our own business in this field are greater than finding jobs and
				will give us satisfaction and success in life for a long time.
				In summary, we believe that founding our own business in geospatial computing will help us advance in
				our careers and give us a lifetime satisfaction rather than choosing to work for others.
